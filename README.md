# Cognado

Search a word in one language to find its [cognates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognate) in another (or the same) language, along with their common ancestry.

For example, you can easily find out that Spanish “mundo 🌎” is related to English “mundane”, “dedo 👆” is related to “digital”, and “puente 🌉” is related to “pontificate”.

You can click on results to go to the relevant Wiktionary entry, or hover over them to see quick definitions.

Built on top of the [etymology search SPARQL API](https://etytree-virtuoso.wmflabs.org/sparql), powered by [etytree](https://etytree.toolforge.org/) and using data from [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Main_Page).

## Limitations

Not all languages or language pairs work equally well, due to different levels of support in etytree, along with different levels of etymology coverage on Wiktionary. As a general rule, European languages mostly give good results, but coverage for other languages is much more patchy.

Occasionally, you’ll also find anomolous results, due to incorrect or out-of-date Wiktionary data.
